# space-to-bakersfield
## summary
This is my working repository within the org. I'll have multiple projects here, whcih all have the ultimate goal of gaining expertise to meet specific aims of the org. 
Any sub-directory titled "proj-'#'" is simply a temp dir for learning purposes only. I will try to fill most dirs with a README.md and most source code files with comments for clear understanding for all. 

### http
Still a bit undefined as I ramp up the projects over time. My current plan is to use this as a base for increasing my proficiency with client-to-server stuff.

### frontend
Again, I'll define this more as I go but I am thinking here can be the base for improving js and js api knowledge -- such as experimenting with pixi, sprites, etc.

### backend
A space to experiment with backend. I'd like my focus here to be with iterations of the C programming language and Golang.

### play
 Here is where I'll try to bring all of it together.
